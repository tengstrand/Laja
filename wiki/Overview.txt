=== What Laja is ===

* Laja is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_processor code generator].
* Laja is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler-compiler parser generator] that uses the code generator and generates parsers for Java.
* Laja supports Context Driven Development (CDD) where the target language is Java.
* It should be possible to run Laja on most variants of Windows, Unix/Linux.
* Laja is Open Source, using [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html GNU General Publi License version 3.0].
* Laja is written to be used by developers with easy of use as the primary goal. Generating text files or creating [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language DSL]'s should be both easy and fun!
* Laja is flexible and extendible:
** Jar files can be added just by putting them in directory LAJA_HOME/lib.
** Support for Groovy.
* Laja is written in Java.

=== The code generator ===

* Has support for creating files out of the box, no add-ons is needed.
* Is integrated with Groovy. You can write Groovy code to gather data to be used by your templates.
* Templates used to generate text files has support for indentation for increased readability, e.g:
<pre>
#set (separator = "")

#write "output.txt"
  #foreach (x in ["one", "two", "three"])
{separator}{x}##
    #set (separator=", ")
  #end
#end
</pre>

instead of:
<pre>
#set (separator = "")

#write "output.txt"
#foreach (x in ["one", "two", "three"])
{separator}{x}##
#set (separator=", ")
#end
#end
</pre>

=== The parser generator ===

Laja is a two-phase [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scannerless_parsing scannerless], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_parsing top-down], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking backtracking] parser generator with support for runtime grammar rules.
One of the main ideas of the parser generator has been to introduce a more object-oriented approach when working with parsing. Another idea was to make it as easy as possible to use without sacrificing functionality.

* With little practice you will be able to create your own external DSLs, even complex ones.
* Spaces and comments are handled the same way as other grammar rules, with no exceptions.
* No configuration files (e.g XML files) is needed when generating a parser.
* You can control the output that will come out from the parsing. This is done by mapping the grammar rules into object structures, which is both simple and powerful.
* The generated parser code and the implementing output classes is separated, which is good!
* You will get compilation failures if the implementing output classes does not follow the interface defined in the grammar, which makes it easy to implement the output classes.
* Laja is prepared to support more languages than Java in the future.

=== Context Driven Development ===
Context Driven Development brings the concept ''context'' to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming object orientation]
by separating ''state'' and ''behaviour'' which gives a number of advantages:
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_%28computer_science%29 State] can be defined in a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming declarative] way which allows that hashCode(), equals() and toString() can be generated.
* The state is built in a more readable and robust way resulting in increases maintainability.
* The state can be validated, and errors can be fixed, before encapsulation takes place
* Have one behaviour representation per context and [http://natureofcode.blogspot.se/2011/08/exploring-nature-of-code.html switch] between them without breaking [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_%28object-oriented_programming%29 encapsulation]
* Encourages [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition composition] over [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_%28object-oriented_programming%29 inheritance] which gives more modular code and facilitates reuse
