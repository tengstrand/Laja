== Getting started ==
Laja is used to generate files with varied content. To make this work you need to do three things:
# [[Install|Installa Laja]]
# Create a template file (text file) in your favourite text editor
# Execute Laja

The Hello World example will show how it works.

== Hello World ==
This example will produce the file ''hello.txt'' with the row ''Hello World!'':

{| class="nogridtable"
! generate.laja !! hello.txt
|-
|
<pre>
#write "hello.txt"
Hello World!
#end
</pre>
|
<pre>
Hello World!

</pre>
|}

* Make sure Laja is [[Install|installed]].
* Create the directory ''helloworld'', e.g. ''C:\helloworld'' (Windows) or ''/usr/local/helloworld'' (Unix/Linux/Mac).
* Create the file ''generate.laja'' in the newly created directory ''helloworld''.
* Edit ''generate.laja'' in a text editor to look like this:
<pre>
#write "hello.txt"
Hello World!
#end
</pre>
* In a shell or DOS prompt:
** Go to directory ''helloworld''
** Type (followed by enter): laja


If everything works as expected, the following is printed out:
<pre>
Reading file "generate.laja"
  Writing to file "C:/helloworld/hello.txt" - OK
</pre>
