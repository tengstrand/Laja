Static context is used to represent a place in the system where a certain task can be performed
and is something that is known at the time the code is written (compile time).
If we use ''person'' as an example, it can perform various tasks in different contexts:

* show it in the GUI
* answer if he or she is a teenager
* represent it as a row in an export format
* be persisted to a database.

Each of these tasks represents a unique context, e.g. ''show in GUI'', ''core domain'', ''export'' and ''persistence''.
The way we allow ''personState'' to operate within a context is to have one or several
behaviour representations for it like ''Person'', ''PersonInGui'', ''PersonRowInFile'' or ''PersistablePerson''.
The context ''core domain'' has the behaviour representation ''Person'' (the other three representations are not included in the chart):

GUI, Domain and Infrastructure are examples of a layered architecture.

=== Layers and tier of deployment ===
It's often a good idea to separate different responsibilities into different logical layers in the codebase (packages/modules) to increase modularity and cohesion.
Don't confuse architectural layers with tiers of deployment (well described [http://gojko.net/2010/06/11/udi-dahan-the-biggest-mistakes-teams-make-when-applying-ddd here]).
Assume that you have control over all source code in your layered system.
If the layers are physically separated (deployed to different physical locations) and a layer (for example the ''GUI'') need access to another layer (for example the ''Domain'')
then the ''domain code'' should also be deployed to the ''GUI'' tier so that we don't need to duplicate our domain rules.


But is this not an example of mixing of responsibility? No, we only ''use'' the "core domain" business rules from the GUI layer, we don't duplicate the code.
It's very similar to calling a service with the difference that instead of sending the state to a service and letting the service operate on it,
we ''encapsulate'' the state so that we can work in a more object oriented way. For example ''person.export()'' instead of ''service.export(person)''.
The latter breaks encapsulation which may lead to a situation where business rules are scattered around the system instead of gathered into one place.

The rule of thumb is that different parts of the codebase should be maintained in ''one place'' but is allowed to be deployed and used from ''many places''.
This helps to keep the code clean and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself DRY].
