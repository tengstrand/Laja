The concept ''context'' is used to describe i place in the system where a task can be performed (static context)
which can vary depending on the context within the static context (dynamic context).

What distinguishes static context from dynamic context is that ''static context'' is actively selected by the developer when the code is written
(compile time) while ''dynamic context'' is selected based on a ''context variable'' that is only known at runtime.

=== Static context ===
If we look at the [https://github.com/tengstrand/Laja/tree/master/src/example/java/cdd/main/net/sf/laja/example/account account] example,
it has behaviour representations for the two contexts ''source'' and ''destination'':
<source>
SourceAccount sourceAccount = Account.balance(1000).asSourceAccount();
DestinationAccount destinationAccount = Account.balance(100).asDestinationAccount();
</source>

<source>
public class SourceAccount extends AccountValue {
    ...
    public void transferTo(DestinationAccount destination, double amount) { ... }
    ...
}
</source>

<source>
public class DestinationAccount extends AccountValue {
    ...
    public void deposit(double amount) { ... }
    ...
}
</source>

The two representations contains the relevant operations to be used in each context.

=== Dynamic context ===
A dynamic context can vary at ''runtime'' within a static context. In the [[Dynamic context|dynamic context]] code example:

<source>
Person person = PersonFactory.name("Anders").phoneNumber("011-11111111").asPerson(userRole);
</source>

...the context variable ''userRole'' is used by the factory to choose a suitable representation
which enables us to have different behaviour implementations for different contexts within the static context.
