The concept ''context'' is divided into two groups,  ''static'' and ''dynamic'':

=== Static context ===
Static context manifests itself as a task in the system.
What distinguishes static from dynamic context is that it is known when the code is written (at ''compile time'').
The technique [[Context switching|context switching]] is used when moving from one context to another.

If we look at the [https://github.com/tengstrand/Laja/tree/master/src/example/java/cdd/main/net/sf/laja/example/account account] example, it has two
different contexts, ''source'' and ''destination'':
<source>
SourceAccount sourceAccount = Account.balance(1000).asSourceAccount();
DestinationAccount destinationAccount = Account.balance(100).asDestinationAccount();
</source>

Each context only contains relevant operations for the context:

<source>
public class SourceAccount extends AccountValue {
    ...
    public void transferTo(DestinationAccount destination, double amount) { ... }
    ...
}
</source>

<source>
public class DestinationAccount extends AccountValue {
    ...
    public void deposit(double amount) { ... }
    ...
}
</source>

=== Dynamic context ===
A dynamic context can vary at ''runtime'' within a static context. If we look at the [[Dynamic context|dynamic context]] code example:

<source>
Person person = PersonFactory.name("Anders").phoneNumber("011-11111111").asPerson(userRole);
</source>

...the context variable ''userRole'' is used by the factory to choose a suitable representation.
