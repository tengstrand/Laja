The site [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/context?s=t dictionary.com] defines context as "the set of circumstances or facts that surround a particular event, situation, etc.".
The snippet "a particular event, situation, etc" is very close to the definition of ''behaviour'' in CDD which is something that
operates in a ''context'' and encloses ''state'' (state = data at a given point in time).

What distinguishes static context from dynamic context is that ''static context'' is actively selected by the developer when the code is written
(compile time) while ''dynamic context'' is selected based on a ''context variable'' that is only known at runtime.

=== Static context ===
If we look at the [https://github.com/tengstrand/Laja/tree/master/src/example/java/cdd/main/net/sf/laja/example/account account] example,
it has behaviour representations for the two contexts ''source'' and ''destination'':
<source>
SourceAccount sourceAccount = Account.balance(1000).asSourceAccount();
DestinationAccount destinationAccount = Account.balance(100).asDestinationAccount();
</source>

<source>
public class SourceAccount extends AccountValue {
    ...
    public void transferTo(DestinationAccount destination, double amount) { ... }
    ...
}
</source>

<source>
public class DestinationAccount extends AccountValue {
    ...
    public void deposit(double amount) { ... }
    ...
}
</source>

The two representations contains the relevant operations to be used in each context.

=== Dynamic context ===
A dynamic context can vary at ''runtime'' within a static context.
If we take a look at the [[Dynamic context|dynamic context]] code example:

<source>
Person person = PersonFactory.name("Anders").phoneNumber("011-11111111").asPerson(userRole);
</source>

...the context variable ''userRole'' is used by the factory to choose a suitable representation
which enables us to have different behaviour implementations for different contexts within the static context.
