Context switching as known here was invented in 2011 and first described in this [http://natureofcode.blogspot.se/2011/08/exploring-nature-of-code.html blog post]
but have been improved since then in a way that state and behaviour now are completely separated.
The ability to have a set of different context representations is an effective way to reduce the amount of code needed to integrate different parts of the system.
The switching is performed without affecting the state format or breaking the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_%28object-oriented_programming%29 encapsulation].
It encourages putting ''behaviour'' inside objects close to its data so they can perform tasks themselves, which is good and follows the [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TellDontAsk Tell Don't Ask] principle.
In addition to a facilitated integration CDD also let us create objects that focus on one task at a time, following the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle Single responsibility] principle.


In an earlier example we switched context to be able to perform the save operation:
<source>
person.asPersistable().save();
</source>

...which can be illustrated by this diagram:


[[File:CDD-context-switch.png|330px]]


The switching was performed by the method ''asPersistable()'':

<source>
package com.myproject.behaviour;

import com.myproject.state.PersonState;

public class Person extends PersonFactory {
    public Person(PersonState state) {
        super(state);
    }

    // (factory)
    public Person asPerson() {
        return new Person(state);
    }

    public PersistablePerson asPersistable() {
        return new PersistablePerson(state);
    }
}
</source>

Context switching allows our objects to switch and perform well defined tasks in different parts of the system almost friction free.
We don't need to convert between different state representations when crossing context borders because the state format never change.
Conversion between state representations are a common source of errors that is almost eliminated in CDD.
Support for letting objects cross physical context borders, by using a standardized text transport format, is not supported in this alpha version but may be added in the future.


Let's take a slightly lager example to illustrate the concept ''context switching''.

Imagine that we start by retrieving an instance from a repository (Context 1), present it in the GUI (Context 2),
perform some editing in the GUI (Context 3) followed by some domain operations (Context 4)
and finishing by writing the state to a file (Context 5).
