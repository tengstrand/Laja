''Context'' is one of key concepts in CDD alongside ''state'' and ''behaviour''.
Context is divided into two parts where the first part ''context area'' has to do with the task to be performed and its location in the system:

The context area is actively selected or [[Context switching|switched]] by the developer at ''compile time''.


The second part is optional and is something that can vary at ''runtime'' within a selected ''context area'':

The selected context is based on a ''context variable''. Examples of such a variable might be:
* Current user role
* Current time
* Configurations, e.g. values from file or database


Different aspects of ''context'' will gradually be covered by the rest of this documentation.
