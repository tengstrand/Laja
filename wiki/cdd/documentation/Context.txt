''Context'' is a key concepts in CDD alongside ''state'' and ''behaviour''.

To consider ''context'' as a first-class citizens allow us to reason about software design in a more concise way.


Context is divided into two groups, ''dynamic'' and ''static'' where the latter describes a task and its location in the system:


[[File:CDD-static-context.png|400px]]


The static context is actively selected or [[Context switching|switched]] by the developer when the code is written (''compile time'').

If we look at the [https://github.com/tengstrand/Laja/tree/master/src/example/java/cdd/main/net/sf/laja/example/account account] example, it has two
different account contexts, ''source'' and ''destination'':
<source>
SourceAccount sourceAccount = Account.balance(1000).asSourceAccount();
DestinationAccount destinationAccount = Account.balance(100).asDestinationAccount();
</source>


The second type of context is ''dynamic'' which is optional and can vary ''within'' a static context at ''runtime'':

An example is the ''configuration'' variable in the [https://github.com/tengstrand/Laja/tree/master/src/example/java/cdd/main/net/sf/laja/example/computer computer example]
which is hardcoded to ''STANDARD'' and ''FAST'' here, but could have been sent in as a variable:

<source>
Amiga standardAmiga = AmigaFactory.owner("Joakim").asAmiga(Configuration.STANDARD);
Amiga fastAmiga = AmigaFactory.owner("Riku").asAmiga(Configuration.FAST);
</source>

When the configuration is set to ''STANDARD'' we will get an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500 Amiga 500]
but when set to ''FAST'' we will get an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_4000 Amiga 4000].


The selected context is based on a ''context variable'' such as:
* Current user role
* Current time
* Different configurations from e.g. file or database

Different aspects of ''context'' will gradually be covered by the rest of this documentation.
