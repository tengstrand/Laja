The concept ''context'' is one of the cornerstones in CDD alongside of ''state'' and ''behaviour''.
Context is divided into two parts where the first part ''context area'' has to do with the task to be performed and its location in the system:

The context area is actively selected by the developer at ''compile time''.


The second part is optional and is something that can vary at ''runtime'' within the context area:

Examples of what a ''context variable'' can consist of are:
* Current user role
* Current time
* Configurations in files and databases


Different aspects of ''context'' will gradually be covered by the rest of this documentation.
