Substates can be "expanded" and merged into the state (the light grey area represents the ''address'' in the following example):

[[File:CDD-state-expansion.png|250px]]


A dollar sign ($) marks a substate for expansion ($ is a valid character for variable names in Java!):
<source>
package com.myproject.state;

public class PersonStateTemplate {
    int ssn; // (key)
    String givenName;
    String surname;
    AddressState $address;
}
</source>

...if we regenerate and change ''main'':
<source>
Person person = Person.ssn(112233).givenName("Ingmar").surname("Bergman")
        .streetName("Main Street").streetNumber(123).zipcode(111222).asPerson();

System.out.println(person);
</source>

...we get the output:
<source>
Person{ssn=112233, givenName='Ingmar', surname='Bergman', streetName='Main Street', streetNumber=123, zipcode=111222}
</source>

As we can see, the attributes from ''AddressState'' has been "exploded" and merged into ''PersonState''.
If we take a look at ''PersonState'' it now extends ''AddressState'':
<source>
...

public interface PersonState extends AddressState {
    ...
}
</source>

...this will allow us to use ''PersonState'' as an "Address" which will be explained more in detail later.


If two or more attributes have the same type and name, they will be merged into a single attribute ''without any warnings''.
This is not how it works in this alpha version but will be changed in a future release!
