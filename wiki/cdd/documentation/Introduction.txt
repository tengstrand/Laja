= Introduction =

Context Driven Development (CDD) is a new approach to object orientation, which allows for a clean separation of ''state'' and ''behaviour''; enabling us to switch an object's context without breaking its encapsulation.
The secret sauce that makes this possible is ''code generation''.
Having all of the CDD foundation classes generated automatically frees developers to just focus on ''what'' the system does instead of ''how'' it does it - resulting in less code, cleaner code and more robust code.

=== Problems ===

I have for quite a long time observed a number of problems in object orientation and had a feeling that not everything was done properly.
Some of the things that bothered me was:

* The absence of the concept ''context'' which makes it hard to work in different contexts and leads to non-object-oriented solutions that force you to break encapsulation and violate the [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TellDontAsk Tell Don't Ask] principle.
* Objects have no connection between its attributes/properties and how the state is built (constructors) and how identity is implemented (''hashCode/equals'').
* Poor flexibility at the object level when it comes to composing objects, switching context and code reuse.


Enjoy!
