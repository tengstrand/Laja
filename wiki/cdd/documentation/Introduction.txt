= Introduction =

Context Driven Development (CDD) is a new approach to object orientation, which allows for a clean separation of ''state'' and ''behaviour''; enabling us to switch an object's context without breaking its encapsulation.
The secret sauce that makes this possible is ''code generation''.
Having all of the CDD foundation classes generated automatically frees developers to just focus on ''what'' the system does instead of ''how'' it does it - resulting in less code, cleaner code and more robust code.

=== What to improve ===

I have for quite a long time observed a number of problems in object-orientation and had a feeling that certain things are not done properly.
Some of the things that bothered me was:

* The absence of the concept ''context'' which makes it hard to work in different contexts and leads to non-object-oriented solutions that force you to violate the [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TellDontAsk Tell Don't Ask] principle.
* The lack of connection between the properties of the object's attributes and how the the initial state is built and how identity is implemented (''hashCode'' / ''equals'').
* Poor flexibility at the object level (class instances) when it comes to composing objects and reusing code.
* That you must choose an implementation of hashCode / equals although it varies depending on the context.


Enjoy!
