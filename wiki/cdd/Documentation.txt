Context Driven Development (CDD) takes a new approach to object orientation by separating ''state'' and ''behaviour''.
That allows you to work in different context without breaking encapsulation.
It's also the foundation that makes it possible to improve the way you build and validate state.
The problem is solved by using ''code generation''.
By using code generation, the amount of code you need to write is reduced to a minimum so you
can focus more on ''what'' to do instead of ''how'' resulting in cleaner and more concise code.
