
This scrip shows an example of how to define macros dynamically.
A macro definition can any time be replaced by another macro definition.

#write "target/test-output/macro-dynamic.out"
  #foreach (x in [1,2])
    #if (x == 1)
      #macro print()
A
      #end
    #else
      #macro print()
B
      #end
    #end
    #print()
  #end
#end
