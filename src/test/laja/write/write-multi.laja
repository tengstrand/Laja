
The following expected behavior is tested:
  - All rows inside the outer write, including the lines inside
    the inner write statement is written to the outer file "write-multi-outer.out".
  - The lines inside the inner write statement is written to "write-multi-inner.out".

#write "target/test-output/write-multi-outer.out"
outer1
  #write "target/test-output/write-multi-inner.out"
    inner1
    inner2
  #end
outer2
#end

Ignored row!
